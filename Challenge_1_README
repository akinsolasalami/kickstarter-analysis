# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
Louise would like to know and understand how different theatre kickstarter campaigns turned out relation to their launch dates and their funding goals.

## Analysis and Challenges
In order to help Louise I wanted to only show the data that she would need in order to make her decision. I made use of pivot tables to make concise summary tables on how theatre campaigns have performed over different months. This will allow Louise to see which months had the most succesful campaigns. The summary table made using the pivot tables tool also allows Louise to avoid certain months to kickstart her campaign as some months have a high number of failed and canceled campaigns.

I also wanted Louise to be able to see the success of different theatre campaigns based on the 'Dollar Goal' for different campaigns. I utilized excel COUNIFS function to be able to count the number of successful, canceled and failed campaigns for different dollar goal ranges.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date & Conclusions 
Based on the Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date evaluation, it would be in Louise's best interest to kickstart her campaign in May or June. These two months had the most successful campaigns. I would advise Louise to avoid starting her campaign in December. From the Chart it clear there is a lot of risk in starting your theatre kickstarer campaing in December as there was almost the same number of failed campaigns as succesful campaings.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals & Conclusions
Looking at the different outcomes based on goals. People prefer to spend less on theatre campaigns. There is a negative relationship between the goal amount and how succesful the campaign is. Although we do so an increase in the percentage of success of campaigns at $25,000 mark they are not still as succesful as smaller goal campagins.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
This was my first time utilize COUNTIFS which was exciting but still required me to be very meticulous about my coding. I made a few errors while attempting the code. I also was not familiar with GitHub in general so this has been a good learning experience. 

### Limitations of this dataset
I thing the dataset is good if Louise is only interested in funding her theatre. If she would like to take it to next level it would be better to have some data on the reviews once the theatre was finished. This sort of information will allow Louise to know wether she should spend more and have a higher goal for her play to boost production. I also think expressing things using percentages is easier to understand.
